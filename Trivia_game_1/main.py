# you will create a simple trivia game for two players
# Starting with player 1, each player gets a turn at answering 5 trivia questions.
# (There should be a total of 10 questions.)
# When a question is displayed, 4 possible answers are also displayed.
# Only one of the answers is correct, and if the player selects the correct answer, he or she earns a point. 
# After answers have been selected for all the questions, the program displays the number of points earned by each
# player and declares the player with the highest number of points the winner.
# To create this program, write a Question class to hold the data for the trivia question.
# The Question class should also have an appropriate __init__ method, accessors, and mutators.
# The program should have a list or a dictionary containing 10 Question Objects, one for each trivia question.
# Make up your own trivia question on the subject or subjects of your choice for the objects.
