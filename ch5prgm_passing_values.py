# Create a program that asks a user to enter a whole number between 20 and 100
# Send that number to a function that will validate the number
# and if it is not a number between 20 and 100, use a while loop to keep asking the user for a valid number
# Return the number to the main function
# In addition, create three functions that determine if the number is divisible by two, by three, and by five
# Pass all of the results to a final function that displays output on the screen - identifying whether or not the number is divisible by two, three, and five.
